### Pair Programming

1. Why is pairing so hard? Because you each have different expertise, interests, and backgrounds. Not to mention different communication and learning styles! It requires the kool-aid man and the chef to make a dish together. This actually is a huge benefit of pairing, because pairing brings balance, and balance brings learning.

### Advice on Pair Programming

Pairing

1. Communicate what you're thinking.
2. Share your preferences and learning needs. Ask the learning needs of your partner and respect those needs.
3. If someone needs the practice/experience, let them drive.
4. Detach yourself from your ideas; allow the best idea for the project to flourish.
5. It's MEANT to be difficult. Sometimes you'll feel dumb OR dragged behind, it's normal. Learning to deal with it like a rational, healthy human adult is part of the process.
6. If there is some confusion or disagreement, understand what a person means/is thinking. The same sentence can mean two completely separate things from different perspectives.
